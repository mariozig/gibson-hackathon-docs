# System Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- Logged in users must be able to record audio stories up to 5 minutes in length
- Logged in users must be able to geo-tag their stories to specific locations
- The system must display story locations on an interactive map
- The system must display story locations on an interactive Google map
- The system must transcribe audio stories automatically using OpenAI Whisper API
- Users must be able to create accounts and log in with email/password using NextAuth.js
- The system must provide audio playback with basic controls
- Users must be able to browse and discover stories by location

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Security: All API keys must be stored securely in environment variables
- Logging: Comprehensive error logging throughout the application
- Responsiveness: The interface must adapt seamlessly between desktop and mobile layouts
- Rebranding: All remnants of the Gibson AI starter app's layout must be replaced with our own

# Technical Architecture

## Design System
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for optimized pages
- UI powered by Hero UI, a Tailwind CSS component library
- Minimalist, responsive design with consistent components
- **Cyberpunk aesthetic** with the following characteristics:
  - Subtle gradients and shadows used thoughtfully
  - Sharp corners preferred over rounded ones
  - Subtle hover animations on interactive elements
  - Clean, minimalist layout with futuristic aesthetic
  - High contrast between elements and text vs background

## System Components

### Frontend Application
- The **existing Next.js 15 app** in the repository will serve as the foundation. It is a starter template from Gibson. We will need to remove Gibon's layout from the starter template and create our own from scratch. All Gibson branding/content/UI needs to be removed in favor of our "Local Stories Vault" website's content. The application features:
  - React 19
  - TypeScript
  - Type-safe client for interacting with the Gibson API
  - React Query + tRPC client that supports loading + error states, automatic caching, refetching, etc.
  - HeroUI components
  - Runtime validation with Zod
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Hot module replacement (HMR)
  - Support for Server Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and Client Side Rendering (CSR)
  - React Server Components
  - Server Actions (with examples)
  - Next.js server (with example HTTP and tRPC API routes)
- The system will prioritize pre-rendering static pages at build time (Static Site Generation - SSG) whenever possible to maximize performance and minimize server load
- **Custom Authentication**: Basic email/password authentication with secure password hashing stored in Gibson AI (no verification required)

### Audio Processing Pipeline
- **Web Audio API & MediaRecorder**: Simple browser-based audio capture
- **Base64 Encoding**: For initial MVP audio storage solution
- **Local File Storage**: Store audio files on the server filesystem for MVP


### Map Services
- **Google Maps JavaScript API**: For basic interactive map rendering with built-in marker clustering

### Backend & Data Persistence
- **Gibson AI**: Database management and main data persistence with schema generated via Gibson tools.
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions to handle the backend logic
- Server-side API layer to query the Gibson AI backend â€” client-side code will never call the database API directly
- **Zod library for robust data type definition and validation**, ensuring data integrity throughout the application, especially for API request/response payloads and database interactions

### Type Generation
- After any changes to the database, we must deploy the schema and then regenerate the type-safe API client using `npm run typegen`
- This ensures proper typing for all API interactions between the frontend and Gibson AI
- The generated file `src/gibson/types.ts` is **read-only** and must **never** be edited manually; it is rebuilt automatically by running the above command
- Deploy all schema changes immediately

## Data Models

### Primary Entities (Simplified for MVP)
- **users**
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: display name
  - email: contact email (unique)
  - password_hash: securely hashed password
  - join_date: timestamp

- **stories**
  - id: unique identifier
  - user_id: creator reference
  - title: story title
  - audio_url: URL path to audio file (local path for MVP)
  - transcript: full text transcription
  - duration: length in seconds
  - latitude: geo-coordinate
  - longitude: geo-coordinate
  - location_name: human-readable location
  - created_at: timestamp

- **tags**
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: tag name (lowercase, unique)

- **story_tags** (junction table)
  - story_id: reference to story
  - tag_id: reference to tag

## APIs and Integrations

### External Services
- **Google Maps Platform**: Basic map rendering with standard markers
- **OpenAI Whisper API**: Audio transcription service
- **Gibson AI**: Database and backend service



### Internal APIs
- **Authentication API**: Handles user signup, login, session management
- **Story API**: Basic CRUD operations for stories and related metadata

### Integration Architecture
- Gibson AI backend API handles all database operations
- Next.js backend makes server-side requests to the Gibson AI API to fetch and render data
- Client-side code only communicates with Next.js API endpoints, never directly with external services

### Security Requirements
- **API Key Management**: All API keys (Gibson AI, Google Maps, OpenAI, etc.) **must** be stored in .env files at the project root
- **Environment Variables**: Keys **must** be accessed securely as environment variables within the Next.js application (respecting `NODE_ENV`)
- **No Hardcoding**: Keys **must never** be hardcoded in source files
- **Configuration Setup**: All environment variables described in `.env.example` will need to be updated in the real env files
- **Gibson AI Integration**: When creating a project in Gibson AI, we will use the MCP tool to fetch some environment variables automatically

## Infrastructure Requirements
- **Database**: Gibson AI for data persistence
- **Storage**: Local filesystem storage for audio files
- **Environment Management**: Separate development and production environments
